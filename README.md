# rdqm-kmod-queries

In addition to the [IBM Support Document on RDQM kernel modules](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-mq-replicated-data-queue-manager-kernel-modules) there is now a [JSON document](https://ibm.biz/mqRdqmKmodJson) and [associated schema](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/messaging/mqadv/ibm-mq-rdqm-kmods.schema.v1-0.json) that provides the most recent information about the validated combinations of:
1. IBM MQ version
2. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Kernel version
3. DRBD kernel module version

This repository contains sample code showing how to query the JSON document. The initial code is [Python](Python/README.md).
